## ðŸŽ¥ App Walkthrough

> **Note:** Unfortunately, this is the only form of demonstration I can provide. Iâ€™ve been working exclusively on FIU library computers, which in 95% of cases failed to run iOS simulators due to extremely outdated and underpowered hardware. Additionally, these machines do not allow installation of third-party recording software such as OBS or screen capture tools.  
>  
> I have included screenshots and GIF walkthroughs with detailed code explanations to demonstrate the appâ€™s core functionality.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Location metadata is only available for photos that contain geotag info.
- Use `PHPickerViewController` instead of the deprecated `UIImagePickerController` for library access.
- Tested using iPhone SE (3rd generation) simulator running iOS 17.2.
